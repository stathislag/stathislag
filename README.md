### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Stathis
#### Frontend Developer


Aspiring Frontend developer From the first moment , when I wrote just a simple "Hello World" in my first program in JavaScript, a new world opened in front of me. I knew what I wanted to do in my life. So, every day I study JavaScript to learn new concepts and technics in order to write a clean code. My goal is to find my dream job as a "Frontend Developer" and write code for production. At the same time, I am learning "Reactjs" to boarder my skillset.
