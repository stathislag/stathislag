### Hi there 👋

Aspiring Frontend developer
From the first moment , when I wrote just a simple "Hello World" in my first program in JavaScript, a new world opened in front of me. I knew what I wanted to do in my life. So, every day I study JavaScript to learn new concepts and technics in order to write a clean code.
My goal is to find my dream job as a "Frontend Developer" and write code for production.
At the same time, I am learning "Reactjs" to boarder my skillset.
